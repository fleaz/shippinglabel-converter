# shippinglabel-converter

The initial reason for this project was the fact that you only get A4 labels from DHL if you are a privat customer. If
you are a business custommer you can get your shipping labels in the classic 4"x6" (100x150mm) format to print them
directly on something like a thermal label printer. Because I'm a privat customer but have such a fancy printer, I
needed a way to modify the A4 label I get from DHL and turn them into a smaller format.

For ease of use this will get a simple web interface.
